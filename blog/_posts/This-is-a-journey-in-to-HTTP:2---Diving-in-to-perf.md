This post is the continuation of the series “This is a journey in to HTTP/2”, you’ll find the first post where I talk about the difference between HTTP protocols [here](https://medium.com/@electrika01/this-is-a-journey-into-http-2-building-blocks-cba57a1e924c) and the second one where I advise whether you should or not use HTTP/2 on your own website [here](https://psychonautgirl.space/blog/2019/01/01/journey-into-http2-should-i-use-it.html). On this post we’ll explore how to find the configuration that fits your needs. Better than giving you a formula that might or might not work for you I’ll try to show you how to find the result that’s going to be optimal for your website.
